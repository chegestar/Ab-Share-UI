Share UI for MeeGo Handset UX
=============================

0. About
--------

Share UI is a set of libraries and executables that implements
platform-wide selection of destinations to share content.

Share UI features D-BUS interface to spawn UX-specific destination selector
and provides clean API for extending list of destinations irrespective to the
UX in use. UX-specific destination selector is clearly separated from the rest
of the framework.

UX-specific destination selector UI is implemented as a dynamically loadable module.
The module is loaded by the UX-specific share-ui executable and asked to provide
actual UI implementation. This allows to keep destination implementations common to
whole platform while having actual UI visualization of them to follow specific
requirements of a platform's UX implementation (Handset, Netbook, IVI, etc).
